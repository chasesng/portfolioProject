 My Portfolio

This is my portfolio to showcase myself as a practicing software developer.
The portfolio has two forms, one if seen on a mobile device / tablet, and the other if seen on a desktop.
I overhauled the code instead of changing font-sizes based on devices so that I would not have to make compromises at all.
